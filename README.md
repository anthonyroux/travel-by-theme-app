# Travel by Theme App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Starting the app

Make sure the [API](https://github.com/daniloteodoro/locations-by-theme-api) is running and you have the correct API url set on file ./config/index.js
(the api by default runs on http://localhost:8080/)

In the project directory, you can run:

 `npm install`
 
 `npm start`

This will install all dependencies and run the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
